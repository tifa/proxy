# proxy

A reverse proxy on Docker to handle connection requests for various apps, that use the same port numbers, hosted on my local machine.


## Instructions

For the application's service in its `compose.yaml` file:

1. "Unexpose" port(s) from the service.
1. Set `networks` to `proxy`.
1. Set `hostname` to the desired hostname (e.g. `my-app.local`).

In this proxy's `compose.yaml` file, make the following updates if necessary:

1. Add an entrypoint and labels for the port number(s) if they do not already exist.
1. Expose the port(s) if not already done.

Add the hostname (e.g. `my-app.local`) to `/etc/hosts`.

Start up.

```sh
make
```

Or recreate.

```sh
make restart
```


## Dashboard

See: [http://proxy.local:8080/dashboard](http://proxy.local/dashboard).

`proxy.local` should be in `/etc/hosts`.

```sh
make dashboard
```
